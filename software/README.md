## OpenAV/software

### Running
This project is an example of how you could integrate the library with dummy sensors. You can integrate them directly into the OpenAV PCB sensors using the respective libraries of the sensors. The project as it is, is completely compatible with Wokwi and other simulators. The current state is meant to demonstrate the realtime course recalculation capabilities of the project.
