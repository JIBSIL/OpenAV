## OpenAV

### Information
The OpenAV PCB was created to be a universal system for rocketry - with a LoRa long distance radio, a SIM800C for geolocation and Internet communication, an ESP32 for WiFi support and an MPU6050 for sensor data, it provides everything you could want in an avionics system. It integrates seamlessly with the OpenAV library to eliminate coding complexity; with a multitude of ready-to-go configurations, it provides support for any kind of rocket.

This project was created with competitive rocketry in mind, and it therefore utilizes optimized algorithms to provide realtime high-accuracy course predictions, even at supersonic speeds. Uncomplicated and open schematics allow for anyone with basic knowledge to add parts to the system (and if you think other people would like it, make sure to open a pull request on our GitHub for it!)

### Using the Project
Currently we have **not** tested the PCB and software's compatibility, so bugs are likely to occur! As we prepare for our first test flight, we will update this repository with fixes and more clear documentation.

Please see the `pcb/` folder for the KiCad 8.0 files and gerbers.

Please see the `software/` folder for information on the OpenAV software and how to run and connect it.
